# Internation Account Converter

Hello Everyone,

I made this app to learn how to use api's with javascript. The api I used is from
http://openexchangerates.org. The api provides update currency exchange rates from 
165 different countries. My app pulls the data from the api and determines what you
bank account balance would look like if you were living in that country.
 
Please visit my website to see it in action
